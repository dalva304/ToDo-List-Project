# Simple To-Do List Web App Project

Used Django, HTML, CSS, js, and python to create a to do list app with a database so that it could store data like usernames, assignments, deadlines. 

Something to improve on this project, features to make it more customizable such as adding background pictures or making it so that some tasks from users are private (not visible) to the admin
